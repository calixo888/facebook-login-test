# Facebook Login test for Uiflow

I have a Facebook Developers app created on my own personal Facebook developers account temporarily, and it is connected to the "facebook-login-test.vercel.app" domain.

This example just shows a basic login example with Facebook, and displays the access token that is grabbed. It's currently only with the "public_profile" and "email" permissions.
